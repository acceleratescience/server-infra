# ADR-002. Naming conventions for the server

Date: 2025-12-05
Status: Proposed

## Context
A cool server needs a cool name. We have 4 powerful GPUs and our naming convention should match that power.

## Possibilities

### Splinter
The server name shall be `splinter`, with each of the GPUs named after each of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:
- `leonardo` (disciplined and skilled)
- `raphael` (strong and quick tempered)
- `donatello` (smart and nerdy)
- `michelangelo` (fun-loving)

Given that our first endpoint will be split across GPUs 0 and 1, it is fitting that the two strongest and most aggressive turtles should take the honors. Also, people making spelling mistakes with the names will be funny.

### Hogwarts
The server name shall be `hogwarts` with each of the GPUs named after each of the houses at Hogwarts:
- `gryffindor` (Honour, valour, loyalty)
- `hufflepuff` (Honour and justice)
- `slytherin` (Where ambition meets cunning)
- `ravenclaw` (Engage, discuss, discover)

### The Jerk
Given that acceleration is the second order derivative of position with respect to time, it makes sense that we use the _third_ order derivative, which is jerk, and the higher order derivatives for the GPU names.

The server name shall therefore be `jerk`, with each of the GPUs named after each of the higher orders:
- `snap`
- `crackle`
- `pop`
- `lock`

## Decision



## Consequences
There are no real consequences.
